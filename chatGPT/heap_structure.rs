// To implement a heap data structure in Rust, you can start by defining a struct to represent a node in the heap. This struct should have two fields: a value to store the data at the node, and a priority to store the priority of the node. The priority is used to determine the order in which nodes are arranged in the heap.

struct Node {
    value: i32,
    priority: i32,
}

// Next, you can define a Heap struct to represent the entire heap. This struct should have a single field, nodes, which is a vector of nodes that make up the heap.

struct Heap {
    nodes: Vec<Node>,
}

// You can then implement methods on the Heap struct to perform various operations on the heap, such as inserting new nodes, extracting the highest-priority node, and maintaining the heap invariant.

// For example, to implement an insert method, you can start by pushing the new node onto the end of the nodes vector and then using a loop to "bubble up" the node to its correct position in the heap.

impl Heap {
    fn insert(&mut self, value: i32, priority: i32) {
        let node = Node { value, priority };
        self.nodes.push(node);

        let mut index = self.nodes.len() - 1;
        while index > 0 {
            let parent = (index - 1) / 2;
            if self.nodes[parent].priority >= self.nodes[index].priority {
                break;
            }
            self.nodes.swap(parent, index);
            index = parent;
        }
    }
}

// This is just one way to implement a heap data structure in Rust. There are many other possible approaches, and you may want to include additional methods and functionality in your implementation. For example, you might also want to implement a pop method that extracts the highest-priority node from the heap and maintains the heap invariant.
