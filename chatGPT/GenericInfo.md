# Hashsets

In Rust, a HashSet is a data structure that stores a collection of unique values in a specific order. It is similar to a set in mathematics, where each element must be unique and cannot be repeated.

HashSets are implemented using a hash table, which allows for fast insertion, deletion, and lookup of values. This makes them an efficient way to store and manipulate large collections of unique values.

HashSets are typically used when you need to store and manipulate a collection of unique values, and you don't care about the order in which they are stored. They are often used in combination with other data structures, such as HashMaps, to create more complex data structures and algorithms.

In Rust, HashSets can be declared using the HashSet type, and values can be inserted, removed, and looked up using various methods provided by the HashSet type. They can also be iterated over using a for loop or other iteration methods.

# Rust Data Structures

The most common data structures in Rust are vectors, arrays, linked lists, hash maps, and hash sets.

Vectors are dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink in size as needed. They are a good choice when you need a dynamic, resizeable data structure that maintains the order of its elements.

Arrays are fixed-size collections of elements that are stored in contiguous memory. They are a good choice when you need a data structure with a fixed size and fast access to its elements by index.

Linked lists are collections of elements that are linked together using pointers. They are a good choice when you need a data structure that supports fast insertion and deletion of elements, but you don't need fast access to elements by index.

Hash maps are data structures that use a hash function to map keys to values. They are a good choice when you need a data structure that supports fast insertion, deletion, and lookup of values based on keys.

Hash sets are data structures that store a collection of unique values in a specific order. They are similar to sets in mathematics, where each element must be unique and cannot be repeated. Hash sets are a good choice when you need to store and manipulate a collection of unique values, and you don't care about the order in which they are stored.

These data structures are used extensively in Rust to implement various algorithms and data structures. They are often used in combination with each other to create more complex data structures and algorithms.
