// To implement a binary search tree in Rust, you can start by defining a struct to represent a node in the tree. This struct should have three fields: a value to store the data at the node, a left field to store the left child of the node, and a right field to store the right child of the node.

struct Node {
    value: i32,
    left: Option<Box<Node>>,
    right: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

// The Option type is used to represent an optional value, and the Box type is used to store the child nodes on the heap rather than on the stack. This allows the tree to grow without any size limitations.

// Next, you can define a BinarySearchTree struct to represent the entire tree. This struct should have a single field, root, which represents the root node of the tree.

struct BinarySearchTree {
    root: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

// You can then implement methods on the BinarySearchTree struct to perform various operations on the tree, such as inserting new nodes, searching for values, and traversing the tree in different orders.

// For example, to implement an insert method, you can start by defining a helper function that takes a value and a reference to a node, and inserts the value into the appropriate position in the subtree rooted at that node. This function should return the new root of the subtree after the value has been inserted.

fn insert(value: i32, node: &mut Option<Box<Node>>) -> &mut Option<Box<Node>> {
    match node {
        Some(n) => {
            // If the value is less than the value at the current node,
            // insert it into the left subtree.
            if value < n.value {
                insert(value, &mut n.left)
            } else {
                // Otherwise, insert it into the right subtree.
                insert(value, &mut n.right)
            }
        }
        None => {
            // If the current node is null, create a new node with
            // the given value and return a reference to it.
            *node = Some(Box::new(Node {
                value,
                left: None,
                right: None,
            }));
            node
        }
    }
}

// You can then use this helper function in the insert method of the BinarySearchTree struct to insert a new value into the tree.

impl BinarySearchTree {
    fn insert(&mut self, value: i32) {
        insert(value, &mut self.root);
    }
}

// This is just one way to implement a binary search tree in Rust. There are many other possible approaches, and you may want to include additional methods and functionality in your implementation.
